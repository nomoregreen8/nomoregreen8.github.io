In the back of my mind, wasn&rsquo;t staying just like this, the two of us, perfect? Why would we ever need to do anything else to be happy?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0">In the realm of the mountains, the lifespans of the spirits varied greatly, determined by the essence of their being. Some were blessed with longevity, thriving for centuries like the towering pines that dotted the landscape, while others burned brightly for only a fleeting moment, illuminating the terrain for a mere week before vanishing. The duration of their existence was determined by a purpose that was ingrained within them, one that would reveal itself at some point in their existence, and thus, they embarked on a journey to fulfill it. Once this purpose was achieved, the Mountain Spirit dissipated, leaving no trace behind, as if they had never existed in the first place. The only remnants of their existence were the footprints they left and their belongings, which eventually faded away into the passing of time.</span></p><p class="c5 c1 c8"><span class="c0">Fate was a mysterious force that remained shrouded in uncertainty until the moment of reckoning. The Spirits, born without knowledge of their ultimate destination, awaited a curious feeling that signaled the beginning of their journey. Grandma likened it to a &quot;tingle in the bones that never fades,&quot; a feeling that was as unsettling as it was exhilarating. But despite her wisdom, Grandma never shared her purpose with me. Her enigmatic smile and evasive answers left me to ponder the purpose of her existence for years after she left this world. The fear of not leaving a mark, of disappearing without a trace, weighed heavily on me. It was a thought that filled me with dread and compelled me to vow to live forever, to avoid embarking on my own journey. I was content to remain on this mountain summit, never to leave its safety, until today.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;I&rsquo;m scared. I&rsquo;m deathly afraid for the day I would feel that first tingle. The inevitable idea that I would leave the world without even a body for burial haunts me to no end. I don&rsquo;t want to disappear without leaving my mark, something that would shout &ldquo;I was here, so don&rsquo;t you dare forget me!&rdquo; For that reason, I vowed to live forever &mdash; as long as possible. To never start my Journey, I would never step foot off this mountain summit, at least, that was until today. Today marked the 100th anniversary of my last day together with Grandma. I felt that today, I needed to at least decorate her makeshift grave with colorful flowers that couldn&rsquo;t grow up here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I took one step at a time, my left foot following my right, my heart pounding with every step. It was the first time in decades that I had ventured so far from my home, and the first time that I had been so close to humans on my own accord. As I descended the mountain, the terrain became more level, and I came upon a small village. Though the villagers were oblivious to my presence unless I allowed them to see me, I still felt a sense of trepidation at the thought of being among them. But my love for Grandma and my need to honor her memory pushed me forward, step by step.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Relationships with humans, or any creature for that matter, aren&rsquo;t needed, lest I trigger my Journey somehow. Grandma had once shared a tragic tale of a Mountain Spirit who had fallen hopelessly in love with a human, and their love had become their purpose. But the love remained one-sided, unrequited and unfulfilled until the human perished, and the Spirit was forced to dissipate. Humans, with their fragility and short lifespans, were viewed as fleeting beings, a mere blip in the grand scheme of the universe. Why should a Mountain Spirit bind themselves to such impermanent creatures? It seemed far wiser to tether oneself to a rock than to risk triggering a journey with the unpredictable nature of human relationships.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Although I had planned to pay as little attention as possible to what was happening around me, my senses were overloaded all the same. The village was vastly different from my last visit, which had been decades ago. The roads were smooth and hard, unlike the rugged terrain of the mountain summit. Were there such smooth yet hard roads? </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">To my left, two children, no more than six years old, scampered away from an elderly woman, laughing and jumping over a cart. Despite her exasperated voice calling them back for what seemed like the millionth time, a faint grin tugged at the corners of the woman&#39;s lips. The bystanders around them went about their day, unfazed by the children&#39;s antics, as if it were an everyday occurrence.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7">Weren&rsquo;t we just like that</span><span class="c3">?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Grandma&rsquo;s face appeared in my mind, angry one moment, breaking into cackling laughter the next when I almost started crying, and turning to shock when I dared to climb further up the tree. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">Further away, and to my right, there was an intoxicating smell coming from a giant wok manned by a cook right behind it. In his white attire with a suspiciously tall hat, he seemed to be dancing with the flames. What he was making wasn&rsquo;t visible as there was a crowd of people encircling the chef as he performed his show. I swallowed my hunger and reluctantly turned away, feeling a bit of sadness mixed with relief as the scent slowly disappeared, and was slowly replaced with the faint, ambient mustiness of the village. I quickened my pace, not daring to lose focus anymore. After some time, a lush, green, and bright clearing came before my eyes. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blue</span><span class="c0">. Not far from me, there was a gathering of tiny flowers that seemed to wrap and warm up my entire being with just their existence. It was as if the stars, the clouds, and the bluest of skies came together and descended as separate small little flowers, standing there nobly, like they were the only things that dared be beautiful in the world. Compared to the cloudy and monotonous tones of the mountain peak, these flowers were alluring beyond my words.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">What are these? </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re forget-me-nots, are they very beautiful?&rdquo; came a bold voice beside me, invading my world. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&mdash;?!&rdquo; I jumped in shock. Unbeknownst to me, a human child had quietly made their presence right next to me. It was a girl that was ten years old at most. What was really surprising was that they could detect me. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;... How can you see me? Aren&rsquo;t you afraid of me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How can I see you? I&rsquo;m blind. You shouldn&rsquo;t talk to yourself so much if you don&rsquo;t want people talking to you.&rdquo; The child replied with some arrogance. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve never met you in the village before, who would come all the way up here? So you must be in my imagination, how can you hurt me?&rdquo; Hearing this, I could barely stifle a laugh, realizing that I had suddenly leaked my spirit whilst being entrapped by the blue of the flowers. I was actually mistaken as a figment of the child&rsquo;s imagination, what an embarrassing matter.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then, how could you know what I was looking at? I could be talking about something else!&rdquo; For a moment, I thought I saw a lonely and melancholic smile on their face, but it was soon replaced by a barrage of words.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because my mother told me these were the most charming flowers in the world. We came here all the time and she&rsquo;d pick some for me. She told me that you could&rsquo;t find flowers prettier anywhere! What else can you be looking at?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&mdash;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey! Let me finish! They&rsquo;re supposed to symbolize true love and respect! When you give these to someone it means that you are making a promise to always remember them, and to keep them in your thoughts. Lovely isn&rsquo;t it? Do you want to see something even prettier? Hurry up, follow me!&rdquo; Without rest, she quickly jumps to the next topic, and is already walking through the forest, completely taking ownership of the place. After Stumbling behind her for a few minutes and wondering how she could move so skillfully along the path, we came onto the ledge of a cliff, and my breath caught in my throat. It felt as if we had arrived from one world to the next. </span></p><p class="c1 c2 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;See? Isn&rsquo;t it nice?&rdquo; The little girl brags smugly. Stunned, I didn&rsquo;t reply. It was certainly nice. The setting sun in the west dyed the grand sky a light and sweet pink-orange. Below us, a few tens of feet, was a vast canopy of giant chartreuse green trees that were becoming many shades darker as the shadows slowly overtook them. In the distance, were rugged terrain of the mountainside falling away into a vast expanse of rolling hills and fields. And even further away, on a particularly high place, was an elegant stream of water draping down the side and into a gorge. The sights along with the slight breeze of spring in the air left to us, a feeling of serenity. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s breathtaking, why did you show me this?&rdquo; I ask after sometime, my eyes still on the horizon. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">She turned towards me with a beaming smile. &ldquo;Because I felt you were sad, whenever I think about sad things, I come here to remind myself of how wonderful life can be. Although I can&rsquo;t take a look, I can still feel the wind on my face, the warmth of the sun, the sounds of the birds, and even the unique smells of the season. You still have to describe what you see to me though!&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t forget to shamelessly reveal the main reason as to why she took me here. In awe of the scenery as I was, I did my best to illustrate the image to her. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0">While we sat there, I reflected on my life so far. Next to me was a tiny and unnamed human child, and for all she knew, I was just her imaginary friend. She couldn&rsquo;t see and has lived not even a decade to my centuries. It was clear that she has suffered, yet she was far more mature than my cowardly self. Instead of living my life like my grandma intended, and how all Mountain Spirits should, I avoided everything to escape my Journey. Over decades and centuries, I had missed out on everything that was ever beautiful. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c7">Taking one last look at the skyline that was now turning dark, I closed my eyes. I won&rsquo;t forget any of it</span><span class="c3">. </span><span class="c0">In that instance, deep within my bones, I felt a peaceful tingling ever so slightly. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c4 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Long after, when the sky became dark and the clouds disappeared from sight, I arrived back to the mountain peak, and placed the gathered forget-me-nots at Grandma&rsquo;s tombstone. Her purpose will forever escape me, but finding my own path helped me understand why she had avoided talking about hers &mdash; because it isn&rsquo;t something that can be explained or done justice with just words. I thought back to what she would repeat to me, finally having grasped my own understanding of it. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Live like the land around us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What I mean is that for every spirit, human, creature, insect, tree, plant, and any other natural soul in the world &hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&hellip; they breathe with the wind and crave sunlight to live through their lives.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just by looking at the nature surrounding us, we can see how we ought-to exist.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If we can feel the unfettered wind blow by, shouldn&rsquo;t we fly freely along it?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shouldn&rsquo;t we choose to give warmth to others&rsquo; hearts, like does the sunlight?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">If a flower stays with us and withers with the passage of time, shouldn&rsquo;t we praise it for having been so dazzling?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And when we see the mountains so steady, the rivers flowing everlastingly, and the trees that fight to stay evergreen, would we be able to stay calm and swear to never give up, for as long as we live?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Strangely, her words ended up shaping my purpose &mdash; to truly live life for everything it has to offer. If one day, I leave home and live to appreciate all that is beautiful in the world, then I will disappear, but I won&rsquo;t be afraid, because I would have lived &hellip; like the land around us. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c6 c2 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6 c2 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c10"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html></div>
