Common sense dictates that the ordinary mind cannot simultaneously dream and be conscious, right? Well, allow me to enlighten you: lucid dreams are not only real, but they&#39;re also far more sinister than you could ever imagine. They&#39;re not some fantastical realm where you can indulge your every whim. In fact, if you make the wrong move, you may find yourself trapped in eternal damnation. Why? Because the mind is a dark and twisted labyrinth, and we are not alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My own nightmarish journey began a few years ago &ndash; or at least, that&#39;s what I believe, as time has become a distorted and elusive concept for me. I was a despondent high school student, searching for an escape from my mundane existence &ndash; not an uncommon tale. That&#39;s when I stumbled upon lucid dreaming: a world hidden within our dreams, far removed from the harsh realities of life. Here, you could traverse the globe, marry your high school sweetheart, or even soar through the sky like a bird! The possibilities were seemingly limitless.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Driven by insatiable curiosity, I began to research how to induce lucid dreaming. The most straightforward method involved reality checks: integrating a specific action into your daily routine to confirm that you were still grounded in the real world. For me, it was attempting to push my hand through a wall. Eventually, this habit would seep into your dreams, and when your hand finally penetrated the wall, regardless of how convincingly real everything appeared, you would know that you were dreaming.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I can still vividly recall my first lucid dream, where I leaped with joy and reveled in the boundless freedom of my newfound world. I indulged in every desire I had ever yearned for, though I won&#39;t divulge those secrets here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As they say, there&#39;s no such thing as a free lunch. In the beginning, I managed to enter a lucid dream once every fortnight. However, during this time, I began to notice a peculiar phenomenon: I would wake up paralyzed, trapped in my own body. I was familiar with the concept of sleep paralysis &ndash; it occurs when the body emerges from REM sleep while the mind retains consciousness, not unlike lucid dreaming. Armed with this knowledge, I didn&#39;t pay it much heed. The initial panic subsided as it gradually became a routine part of my life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But then, something far more unsettling began to transpire. Shortly after my sleep paralysis episodes commenced, I detected a sinister presence lurking just beyond my field of vision. It was always there, haunting me, shifting locations &ndash; to my left, my right, on the ceiling, or even beneath my bed. Each time, it drew nearer and nearer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The sheer terror was indescribable, at least until I later discovered that these so-called &quot;sleep paralysis demons&quot; were supposedly the result of hallucinations during sleep paralysis.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As it turned out, there was something far more nefarious at play. The presence I had sensed began to manifest itself in my waking life &ndash; a fleeting shadow in the corner of my eye, a chilling whisper in my ear, an inexplicable chill running down my spine. Each time I tried to confront it, it vanished into thin air, as though it was all a figment of my imagination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t know what else to do. I surmised that lucid dreaming was the catalyst for these bizarre occurrences, so I endeavored to stop. But to my horror, my lucid dreams only became more frequent &ndash; from once a fortnight to every other day. At least the sleep paralysis had ceased, right? Alas, that was not the case. I began to sense the presence in my dreams as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It felt like a never-ending game of cat and mouse, where I was undoubtedly the prey. The terror was all-consuming, and I could feel my sanity starting to fray at the edges.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Over time, the presence evolved from a vague, intuitive sensation to something more tangible and menacing. It felt as though someone or something was constantly lurking behind me, its icy grip tightening around my heart. A creeping sense of dread permeated my every waking moment and seeped into my dreams.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This continued until one fateful day when, at last, I caught a glimpse of the elusive presence. Or, perhaps more accurately, it caught me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I can still vividly recall that first Friday night of March. As usual, I drifted off to sleep and found myself immersed in the familiar landscape of my dreams (by then, I was experiencing lucid dreams every single day). I went about my usual activities when, suddenly, that all-too-familiar sensation washed over me. I whipped my head around, fully expecting to find nothing but the scenery of my dreamscape. Instead, there it stood.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It was my math teacher.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I couldn&#39;t help but laugh, but in the blink of an eye, his form shifted and warped. The constraints of human flesh crumbled away, revealing a monstrous creature straight out of my darkest nightmares. Its humanoid body appeared to be wrought from shadows, writhing and contorting in the most unnatural ways. Its eyes burned with an evil, red glow, while its grotesque, unnaturally wide mouth twisted into a sinister grin that sent shivers down my spine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As it advanced, a putrid stench filled the air &ndash; the sickening odor of decay mingling with the acrid scent of burning chemicals. Its movements were erratic and unpredictable, like a marionette in the hands of a malevolent puppeteer. And I, too, was powerless to resist, unable to move or even think. The once-secure domain of my dreams had been hijacked by this malevolent force.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As it closed the distance between us, it stopped just short of touching me &ndash; much to my relief. It then began to speak in a voice that was a guttural, rasping growl, reminiscent of rocks grinding together. It uttered words in a language that was both alien and terrifying, yet somehow conveyed an unmistakable sense of malice and insanity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Somehow, I understood its message.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It called itself the Dream Plotter &ndash; an embodiment of the dark and twisted thoughts that lurked in the recesses of the human mind. It fed upon the emotions of its victims, savoring their fear above all else. Once it had gorged itself on their terror, its prey would be reduced to a hollow shell, their memories and vitality erased for eternity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As it spoke, the horrifying reality of my situation became all too clear: I was not simply trapped in a nightmare, but a waking terror from which there may be no escape.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You may wonder how I managed to write this account, and how I appear to be unscathed. Well, the truth is that I struck a deal with the Dream Plotter &ndash; a bargain that would ensure my safety in exchange for supplying it with more unsuspecting souls to prey upon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You see, we are never truly alone when we dream. The Dream Plotter has always been there, lurking in the shadows of each person&#39;s nightmares. The heightened awareness of lucid dreaming merely opens the door for it to strike.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But it doesn&#39;t actually require one to lucid dream first. It simply needs its victims to become aware of its existence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">If you have read this far, well, I guess you have already realized what I have done.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And if you haven&rsquo;t, I deeply regret that you have read my story, for I have willfully ensnared you in the Dream Plotter&#39;s web. All I can offer you now is a solemn warning: unless you are a pure individual with no skeletons in your closet, heed my words carefully. The next time you sense something lurking behind you, regardless of how frightened &nbsp;you become or how strong the temptation is to confront it, never, ever look back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">For the Dream Plotter is waiting, biding its time, eager to ensure you in its malevolent grasp. The link between dreams and reality has become blurred, and the boundaries of your mind are no longer a sanctuary. So tread carefully, dear reader, and remember that some secrets are best left undiscovered. For within the darkness of your dreams, unspeakable horrors lie in wait &ndash; and now, they are coming for you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html></div>
