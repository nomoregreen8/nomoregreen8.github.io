I observed her, my heart filled with amusement, my fingers thoughtfully stroking the beard that had long since transformed into a cascade of striking silver. Ah, the audacity of youth - so eager to defy the tides and confront dragons in their lairs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Then, when do you suppose you&#39;ll wield magic?&quot; I teased her, a playful glint in my eye. &quot;For all the Wizard Kings possessed such power even as they crawled in their swaddling clothes!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet, rather than responding in kind with the usual spirited banter I had come to expect from my ferocious little cherub, she regarded me with a determination far beyond her tender years.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I will most assuredly become the Wizard King,&quot; she declared solemnly. &quot;But, Grandpa, I require your tutelage!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her words caught me unawares, and the memories of my own youth surged forth like a tidal wave. A prodigious Mage, unmatched in my generation, endowed with an affinity for four elements and talents that shook the very earth. I, too, had once dreamed of ascending to the esteemed rank of Wizard King. Alas, despite my gifts, that elusive mantle remained forever beyond my grasp. Instead, I found solace and purpose as a professor at the nation&#39;s most prestigious magical academy - a respectable station, indeed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, for this precious child, reality would soon bare its jagged teeth. I prayed that day might never dawn, but in the depths of my soul, I recognized its inevitability. Her mother, my cherished daughter, had been something of a prodigy herself. Yet, she had been beguiled by an unremarkable Mage. With a less accomplished father, how could Maybelline&#39;s abilities ever hope to rival those of the truly exceptional? Her inability to harness magic at this age was evidence enough.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nevertheless, as her doting grandfather, it was my duty to bolster her spirits. &quot;Very well, my dear, but you must approach your studies with utmost seriousness,&quot; I counseled her. &quot;When you have harnessed the arcane arts, seek me out, and I, the illustrious Grandpa Lucius, shall mentor you personally.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her large, amber eyes shimmered with a brilliance I had never before witnessed as she rushed forward to embrace me in a fierce hug. In that moment, I understood that her dreams were not the fleeting whims of a child. She had pondered and nurtured them in the secret chambers of her heart, and I had unwittingly stumbled into her snare. Yet, it was a trap I would gladly surrender to a thousand times over.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Still, my sweet Maybelline, why do you yearn for power? Are you prepared for the sting of disappointment?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">****</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A year later, with the breezes of spring, Maybelline burst into my study, her delicate strands of pale green hair dancing behind her in two playful pigtails. Her eyes, wide with anticipation, seemed to hold within them echoes of Irina, evoking a melancholy m&eacute;lange of nostalgia and regret.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Feigning disinterest, I chose to maintain the illusion of being absorbed in the correspondence before me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Ahem,&quot; she cleared her throat, maintaining a respectful distance as she sought to command my attention. It was nothing short of charming how she could adopt such an air of formality within the hallowed halls of the Wizard tower, a stark contrast to the unbridled spontaneity she exhibited at home. Nonetheless, I resolved to chastise whoever had granted her entry.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lifting my gaze, I inquired sternly, &quot;Young lady, who permitted your entrance?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;Uh, you know...&quot; she stammered, her eyes shutting tight, revealing the half-moons of her quivering eyelids, as though she could somehow conceal the truth from me. The endearing innocence, so reminiscent of another, was at once heartwarming and bittersweet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I just got in, okay?&quot; Her eyes sprang open as she brazenly spun a threadbare falsehood.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unable to suppress a smile, I revealed my toothy grin. Truth be told, I harbored no resentment over her presence; on the contrary, it was a welcome reprieve from the tiresome procession of wizened men who visited only to burden me with more documents to peruse.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;More to the point, Grandfather,&quot; she began, her excitement near to overflowing. &quot;From this day forth, I am a wizard!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maybelline continued, her eyes sparkling, &quot;The mister said I have an affinity for wind and fire!&quot;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My heart shattered, for this was a story as ancient as time itself. Maybelline hadn&#39;t yet realized that her gifts might never be enough.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stayed there, just looking at her for a few seconds as silence pursed the air. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;...Grandpa, do you remember your promise?&rdquo; She adds. She sounds so nervous, how could I let her down?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;First and foremost, congratulations, Maybelline Stillheart. May your journey be ever wondrous, your adventures exhilarating, and your talents perpetually blooming,&quot; I told her, genuinely and wholeheartedly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Whats that&hellip; that&rsquo;s embarrassing, Grandpa,&rdquo; she replies to me while grinning happily, as the hint of disappointment shaped previously in her contours vanished in an instant.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She then found a seat next to me and launched into an animated monologue. She spoke of her day, her dreams for the future, her excitement, her fears, and anything else that crossed her lively mind. I indulged her as best as I could, the somber grayness of my existence gradually dissolving into the vibrant hues of her youthful exuberance.</span></p></body></html></div>
