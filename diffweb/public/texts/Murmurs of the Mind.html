The whispers had told Devlin so. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The whispers had begun as soft murmurs, pleading in his head, but gradually crescendoed into a cacophony of hissing voices that harried him relentlessly to catch the murderer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">THEY WILL PERISH. SUFFERING. DOOM AWAITS. MURDERER. HALT HIM. SAVE THEM. THEY WILL DIE.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">The message repeated, unyielding. But then they ceased abruptly, just as he couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore, leaving behind a creeping tension. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">Was it the voice of the divine, or &ndash; was it a trap by the Devil? In any case, the voices had always proven true in the past, Devlin didn&rsquo;t question its validity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Catching the murderer himself, however, was not anywhere near the top of Devlin&rsquo;s to-do list. Hell, he wasn&rsquo;t a detective, nor was he armed &ndash; he was just an average man, a middle-aged working stiff!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And who could the murderer possibly be? There were well more than a hundred passengers aboard the Express. It was a hopeless task from the start!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">There was also a colossal problem&hellip; What if he was a part of &lsquo;they&rsquo;? He didn&rsquo;t want to die.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Devlin bit his thumb, looking around nervously. Anyone could be the murderer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The lady sitting before him, for instance. She keeps persistently tapping her foot nervously, and every so often, she glances around furtively, as if ensuring no one was observing her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Or what about the chap in the seat directly to the left of him? He keeps adjusting his spectacles, and the page of his book hadn&rsquo;t changed since he arrived. Was he simply lost in the novel, or was it something more sinister?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The suspense was overwhelming. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Devlin checked the time and stood up, brushing against the bookworm next to him, who shifted in his seat. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">First things first, he needed to get to somewhere safe. His hands trembled, but he managed to slide the door open after a failed attempt. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As Devlin stepped out of the cabin, he made his way towards the lavatory which was at the end of the car. The air was thick with the foreboding scent of doom, as if an invisible fog had enshrouded the train. The rattling of the train carriages seemed to echo the pounding of his heart as he walked down the narrow corridor, his eyes darting from one passenger to the next.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Every shadow, every creaking floorboard, made his skin crawl with trepidation. The mere thought of the impending murder sent shivers down his spine. Was the killer watching him at that very moment, waiting to pounce on his prey?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Devlin was getting closer&hellip; he could already imagine the warm embrace of security.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He passed by a couple whispering to each other, their eyes glancing in his direction before quickly looking away. Were they discussing something wicked, or was it just his own paranoia getting the best of him? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Further down the aisle, he saw a man staring at him with piercing eyes. The man&#39;s face was a mask of calm, but his gaze made Devlin feel as if he was being dissected, as if the man could read his every thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, the train let out a loud screech, causing Devlin to jump. The abrupt noise added to his growing sense of dread, and he hastened his pace, nearly breaking into a run. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In a brief moment, he went past a set of curtains, finally arriving at the lavatory door, only to realize to his horror that it was occupied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After a few minutes went by, the stranger still didn&rsquo;t seem to have any intentions of leaving anytime soon. Devlin grunted impatiently, tapping his feet, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the hold up there, chum? I&rsquo;ve been waiting for the loo for ages!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He sounded angry, but one would be able to hear a slight quiver in his voice. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Apologies for the wait, old boy, I&rsquo;ll be done in a jiffy.&rdquo; A muffled voice sounded back. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After some shuffling and a minute later, a portly bald gent emerged. He grinned at Devlin, &ldquo;Mind the latch, it&rsquo;s a tad finicky!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know how to use a latch, thank you very much,&rdquo; Devlin scowled and snapped back. He pushed past the stout man and entered the privy, slamming down the latch. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Within the water closet, Devlin let out a tremendous sigh. He reached in his pocket and retrieved a cigarette before lighting it up. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After the nicotine brought him back to a more relaxed state, Devlin felt a pang of shame. People were going to perish because he had not taken action.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But what could he have done? Finding the murderer was impossible, and no one would believe him if he told them the truth anyway! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As he focused his attention on the flicker overhead light, trying not to think about what would happen, a sudden commotion erupted from the other end of the carriage. The air was filled with shouts and screams that pierced through his ears, and he stood frozen, his heart pounding against his chest. It had happened! </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The screaming and pandemonium outside continued for what seemed like eternity. To Devlin&rsquo;s fright, he heard a pair of footsteps rush to his location before trying to force open the door! But like a spectre, they left as soon as they came. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The shouts persisted for a while and then grew distant. But what replaced them was infinitely more bone-chilling. From the gaps and cracks between the lavatory and the outside, a drifting aroma of rust seeped through. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Devlin&rsquo;s entire being froze. He wasn&rsquo;t a fool; the pungent metallic stench was surely blood. How many people would have needed to die? He didn&rsquo;t dare guess. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Devlin remained hidden in the lavatory, his heart pounding in his chest. His breathing was shallow, and he felt as if the walls were closing in on him. Sweat beaded on his forehead as he tried to hold back the urge to retch from the smell of blood wafting in.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Though he knew he should have done something to help the person who tried to open the door, his fear held him back. He was terrified of what might happen if he left the lavatory. The thought of coming face-to-face with the killer was more than he could bear.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The screams outside had subsided entirely, leaving an eerie hush that filled the carriage. Devlin&#39;s heart raced as he wondered what was happening. His fear intensified as he realized that the killer could still be out there, searching for the next victim. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly, there was a loud rap on the privy door, making Devlin jump. He could hear someone breathing heavily on the other side. His heart raced, and he knew that the killer had finally found him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&quot;Open the door,&quot; a gravelly and sinister voice demanded. &ldquo;... I can smell you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Devlin hesitated, his body quivering in fear. He knew that if he opened the door, it would be the end of him. But what choice did he have?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With a shaking hand, he slowly unlocked the door and steeled himself for the worst. As it creaked open, a figure came before Devlin&rsquo;s eyes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Whatever it was, it wasn&rsquo;t human. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Talons for hands, horns on its head, and a body covered in blood dyed scales. But the most blood curdling thing was the pair of empty black voids where its eyes should have been. </span></p><p class="c2"> <br> <span class="c0">Devlin tried to slam the door closed immediately out of instinct, but the talons dashed between the frame and the door at an inhuman speed, blocking the action and swinging the door wide open.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Instead of attacking him, the monster seemed to take a moment to size him up. There was a hint of amusement in the creature&#39;s eyes, as if he could sense Devlin&#39;s overwhelming fear.</span></p><p class="c2"> <br> <span class="c0">&quot;You&#39;ve been hiding in here the whole time, haven&#39;t you?&quot; it taunted, a twisted smile playing on their lips. &quot;You must be a real coward.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Devlin couldn&#39;t even find the strength to respond. All he could do was nod, his eyes filling with tears.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The creature seemed to enjoy the sight of Devlin&#39;s terror. It took a step closer, raising the talons it had used to kill the others. Devlin knew that this was the end, and yet he could do nothing but cower in fear, waiting for the inevitable blow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But as it readied to strike, something seemed to give Devlin a moment of clarity. He suddenly realized that he couldn&#39;t just stand there and let this monster take his life. He had to try to fight back, no matter how terrified he was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With the last ounce of courage he could muster, Devlin lunged at the humanoid figure, using the element of surprise to his advantage. The two of them struggled, but Devlin&#39;s determination to survive was stronger than his fear.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">After a few seconds of scrambling, Devlin surprisingly held the advantage. The talons hurt like the dickens, but they somehow didn&rsquo;t pierce his skin. The creature tried to push him off of it, but he kept his center of gravity low.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">With a spirited bellow, Devlin tore away his hands, which were holding the creature&rsquo;s limbs, and moved them to its throat. He squeezed and squeezed, with every fiber of his being.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The creature struggled desperately, trying to pry his hands away from its throat. But it was futile. In mere moments, the murderous fiend slumped, lifeless, its pitch-black, vacuous eyes bulging.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Devlin&#39;s hands squeezed tighter, his fingers digging into the flesh of the already deceased creature&#39;s throat. The adrenaline that had been driving him relentlessly began to ebb, and as his vision cleared, a horrifying revelation settled into the core of his being, like the slow creep of a winter frost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">He stared down at the lifeless body beneath him, the monstrous visage he had perceived just moments ago dissolving before his eyes. The grotesque features that had tormented his mind were now replaced by the familiar contours of a human face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It wasn&#39;t some nightmare come to life that he had slain. It was a fellow passenger! The lifeless body belonged to a man of average build with graying hair, his face now twisted in the agony of his final moments. No wonder he had been able to overpower it so easily! It wasn&#39;t a monstrous being; Devlin had been hallucinating the entire time!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As the truth sank in, Devlin&#39;s heart clenched with a sickening mixture of horror and guilt. He had taken an innocent life, deceived by his own mind&#39;s twisted creations. A cold sweat broke out on his forehead as he struggled to process the gruesome reality of what he had done. The voices never lied.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Devlin felt his stomach churn as he took in the situation. Panic gnawed at him, but he knew he had to act quickly. What could he do? What could he do? Oh, dear Lord.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">An idea flashed through his frantic mind. He darted a glance to his left. Thankfully, the curtains were still drawn. With trembling hands, Devlin dragged the dead man into the lavatory. He propped him up in a sitting position on the toilet before hastily shutting the door behind him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Devlin peered through the curtains, ensuring that no one was coming his way. The coast was clear, so he cautiously made his way back to the private cabin. His head spun, and the voices of the passengers, which he had thought had all but met their doom, were nothing more than a muted hum.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">However, just as he reached the door of the private cabin, a voice not too far behind him rang out, clear and distinct, unlike the others. &quot;Excuse me, lad, would you kindly step out, so I can get out?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Devlin&#39;s head snapped back, his hands, inches from the door, frozen in place. He watched as a young teenage boy stepped out of his seat and into the corridor, allowing an older woman to pass.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Again, Devlin&rsquo;s heart began thumping loudly, and the whispers came back, threatening to drown him in their cacophony. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html></div>
